# LearningML
Learning Machine Learning through projects is a great way to 
understand how things work. I will be working on some simple 
projects that incorporate machine learning aspects from libraries 
such as Pandas, Scikit Learn, Numpy, MatplotLib. 

All of my projects will be completed on google colab and will be
pushed to this repository. 

I will also be using the book 'Hands on Machine Learning with 
scikit learn, keras and Tensor Flow' by Geron Aurelien as by 
guide.
